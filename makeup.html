<h3 id="sec-1-1"><span class="section-number-3">1.1</span> What is meant by desiderata?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">

<p>That-which-is-desired. Three subjects make up the whole of
desiderata; aesthetics, ethics and reason. The importance of the
individual subjects can vary, but together they create something
bigger than the sum of the parts. It's an approach to change that is
not reactive.

<h3 id="sec-1-2"><span class="section-number-3">1.2</span> In what ways is it important for the practice of interaction design?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">

<p>It's an escape route from traditional approaches to change. For
example, the "sweep-in" approach is characterized by the need find a
solution quickly by rigorous examination. That can lead to
analysis-paralysis according to the authors. The "Block-out" approach
is the opposite, using a pre-made solution in different situations,
which is often too simplistic and/or doesn't fit the desires of the
people.
</p>
<p>
I think it's important because it is truly freeing, getting rid of
preconceptions, a way to ask deep/hard questions. I think that is a
way to greatness.

<h3 id="sec-1-3"><span class="section-number-3">1.3</span> How do you come up with the desiderata for a particular design task?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-3">

<p>A desiderata assessment is more than understanding needs and what
currently does not satisfy those needs. It's an understanding of the
motivation behind the desire. The why. A need is a baseline, a desire
is not something we need, but something we want. Envision what we
want to happen, not what we need to happen.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">

<p>What a fantastic paper! Truly visionary and inspiring. I think we're
on the path towards the ubiquitous computing vision that's presented. A
lot of the features in current smartphones and tablets certainly
fulfills that vision. Location aware and kind of purpose built. On
the other hand, they are pretty much used just as personal
computers. This might be because of the prize problem. The devices
are still expensive, so they're not really ubiquitous. The progress
in smaller devices has so far mostly been in making them as capable
as the personal computers. I'm not sure it's in the interest of
computer manufacturers to stop hardware progress and make the
hardware cheaper. That's concerning. Performance benefits still
sells, for both PCs and smartphones. Maybe it'll take a long time
before we're happy enough with computer performance to make them
ubiquitous?

<h2 id="sec-3"><span class="section-number-2">3</span> <a href="http://www.bratton.info/projects/talks/we-need-to-talk-about-ted/">The TED talk critizising TED</a></h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">

<p>His critique boils down to that TED talks are an escape from
reality. It is a waste of highly intellectual people's time and not
only that, it's a poison that maintain the delusion of "if we just
keep innovating as we've done before everything will be all
right". He argues that this is not the case, humanity needs to start
dealing with it's biggest problems head on. He goes on to bash TED's
format letter by letter. He also has a problem with over-simplification.
</p>
<p>
I have a hard time understanding his cynicism and disgust with
TED. Is TED really that important? Are a lot of people wasting a lot
of time on TED? I don't think so, and if they are, it's probably
because they want to. People aren't machines, he talks about quality
of life, I happen to think that "wasting" time is part of quality of
life. Who are you to be dictating what I spend my time doing?
</p>
<p>
As for the delusion of innovation, I can agree to some
extent. However, I don't think that TED is so all-powerful as he
makes it out to be. He compares TED to Fox News. He's never going to
get to the people that's already drinking the Kool-Aid. In short, I
think he wasted his time on TED.

<h2 id="sec-4"><span class="section-number-2">4</span> <a href="http://www.interaction-design.org/encyclopedia/visual_aesthetics.html">Visual aesthetics</a></h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">

<p>The paper argues for the value of aesthetics in interaction
design. In particular how things looks, and it's effect on users.
Aesthetics is hard and can't be be boiled down to guidelines, but
guidelines can help (symmetry, color palettes etc.). Experiments are
imperative. What's considered beautiful is also ever-changing, especially
in computer interfaces.
</p>
<p>
Evaluation of visual aesthetics have often been short-term, first
impression style. Although that's important, the author thinks that
the long-term perspective needs to be explored further.
</p>
<p>
One commentary is critisizing the scoping of
aesthetics. Yes there is more to aesthetics than what's described in
the paper, but I'm not sure it's written such a prescriptive way that
we should consider the presented approach the "only way". Another
commentary adds that context is an important part of visual
design. True, beauty comes in many forms, and the setting can be
crucial for a piece to achieve its full potential.

<h2 id="sec-5"><span class="section-number-2">5</span> Related work - <a href="http://seene.co">Seene</a></h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">

<p>There’s currently an app on the Apple App Store called Seene, which
let’s users create a limited 3D-model by filming it with your
smartphone. The resulting model can be interacted with by other users,
but it is limited to narrow angles. It’s relevant, but not sufficient
to make our vision come true. Seene’s model only gives an illusion of
3D, with a limited set of reference points to stitch together the
image. We need the ability to create a model with sufficient
resolution to make clothing fit close to how they would in real life.
