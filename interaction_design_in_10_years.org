_Interaction design in 10 years._
by Jacob HÃ¥kansson.
* What do you think interactive technology will be like in 10 years from now (i.e. in year 2024)?
  There might be a new "standard medium" for interaction, like touchscreens are
  right now. That doesn't mean that there might exist several new ways of
  interacting with computers, just that it takes a while for them to be adopted by
  a large portion of users.
* What will stay the same, and what will have changed?
  Keyboards will still be around, but might be less ubiquitous, depending how much
  Speech-to-text has evolved. Screens will still be everywhere but in even more
  form factors and materials.
* Do you think more or less will have changed, compared with the past 10 years ago (i.e. since 2004)?
  I believe in the acceleration of technological advances, and as such I think
  that at least 2 (very arbitrary number) disruptive or novel interaction methods
  will have reached consumers. It will have changed more than the last 10 years.
* Will it be different or similar to e.g. science fiction? (please refer to specific books or movies if you like!)
  Minority Report comes to mind. Projected 3D interfaces. They already exists in
  some implementations, but might be productized in the years to come. Speech
  will continue progressing, and is used in multiple sci-fi pieces, Star Trek TOS
  for example.
* How would you like to affect the development, as an interaction designer?
  I would love to be part of a team that works with novel interaction
  technologies, and although I don't primarily view myself as an interaction
  designer, I hope to contribute to a product or research project that changes the
  way people interact with computers.
* Bring up hopes, wishes, fears and fantasies, but try and be as realistic as you can!
  I sincerely hope that multimodal interfaces will be more commonplace and that
  touch won't mean a picture behind glass.
